All scenarios projected from 2015 to 2050:

**Benchmark scenario**: Identical to SSP2 from [Koch & Leimbach (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2023.103156), including COVID shock but not Ukraine war.

**Ukraine War** (previously called Short-War) scenario: Same as the benchmark scenario but we use the latest IMF GDP estimates till the year 2027 which include the Ukraine war. Afterwards, a linear transition over 1 years back to SSP2 growth rates is implemented. Exception: Ukraine is estimated to have a 35% decrease in GDP in 2022 and the IMF does not provide estimates for the following year. Using a linear transition to SSP2 growth rates till 2028 would reduce Ukraines GDP very drastically. Instead we assume that in 2023 Ukraine has another 17.5% GDP  decrease and in 2024 the growth is zero. Afterwards (2025  and ongoing), we estimate Ukraine to again follow the SSP2 growth rates.

**Recovery in Europe** (Scenario B): The same as the Ukraine War scenario till 2027 but afterwards European countries will transition towards the SSP with highest growth rates and developing countries will transition towards the SSP with lowest growth rates. All other countries will transition towards SSP2.

**Rise of the East** (Scenario C): The same as the Ukraine War scenario till 2027 but afterwards developing countries will transition towards the SSP with highest growth rates and European countries will transition towards the SSP with lowest growth rates. All other countries will transition towards SSP2.

**IGC** (Intensifying Global Competition): The same as the Ukraine War scenario till 2027 but afterwards every country with a projected GDPc less than 15000$ in 2040 will linearly transition to 15000$ in 2040 and afterwards keep on growing with SSP2 growth rates. All countries with a GDPc higher than 15000$ will behave the same as in the short-war scenario. This “catch-up” behaviour of poorer countries is inspired by the “CAP” and “FAIR” GDP scenarios in [Bodirsky et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43016-022-00500-3).

**No Migration**: Same as Benchmark scenario but with no international migration.
